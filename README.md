### Goal

- train Cifar-10
- follow constraints
- maximize accuracy

### Code Constraints

- Maximum 11 layer
  - Layers that don't have parameter are not considered as layer.
- Maximum 50 epoch
- No extra DB. Use only Cifar-10
- NO pretrain model. train from scratch

### Skeleton Code

- Followed VGG model : 78.31%
  - 8 Covn, 1 FC
  - 20 epoch

### Report

- font size: 10
- 1 page
- Itemize with contribution
  - When I change this, 5% accuracy increased.
  - Reason is this.
- Include loss graph
